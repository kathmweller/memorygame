## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

For details, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

##Play

The player clicks one card to reveal its underlying symbol.
The player then clicks on a second card.  
If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
If the cards do not match, both cards will flip face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

##Endgame

When all cards have been matched, a congratulations modal will pop-up letting the player know how many moves, how much time it took complete game, and star rating.
